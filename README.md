## About
This is a 2D puzzle-platformer game originally developed as a course project for [EECS494 Game Design and Implementation](https://www.eecs.umich.edu/eecs/academics/courses/eecs-494.html) @ University of Michigan.

The name **GuruGuru** (ã‚°ãƒ«ã‚°ãƒ«) means rotation in Japanese. This is because when you dash and hit the wall in the game, the map rotates around you.

You would probably understand what I meant playing the game. [**Check it out here**](https://qinyeli.github.io/GuruGuru/)! Use

* Arrow keys to control left and right
* Space key to jump, and
* Shift key to dash in the direction you are facing

I'll have to say that the game is a bit hard (ðŸ¤ª sorry), as it was overfitted to a couple of friends who playtested this for me. They happened to be ridiculously good at platforming games.
