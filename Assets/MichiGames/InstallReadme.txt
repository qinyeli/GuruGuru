==MichiGames Installation Instructions==
After opening the unitypackage within Unity, you should have a "MichiGames" folder in your project's Assets folder.

Steps:
(1) Drag the MichiGamesCabinetManager prefab into THE FIRST SCENE IN YOUR GAME. That is, the first scene that the player is guaranteed to see. This might be a title screen scene, a company logo screen, etc.
(2) The package includes the free version of InControl. Be sure to delete it if you already have InControl in your project. Check the console for any additional InControl setup you may need to perform.
